# Surfboard Image Validator

## Project Description

The Surfboard Image Validator is a proof-of-concept application that uses GPT-4o to rate second-hand surfboards and other water sports equipment. The application allows users to upload images of surfboards from different views (top, bottom, sides, etc.) and validates these images, providing a rating from 0 to 10. If an image does not match the expected view, the application prompts the user to upload a new image with the correct view. This project demonstrates the power of AI in automating the review process for second-hand sports equipment, helping people sell their products quickly.

## Dependencies

The project requires the following dependencies:

- `gradio`
- `openai`
- `pillow`

These dependencies are listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

## Installation

To install the required dependencies, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the dependencies using the `requirements.txt` file:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To run the application, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have set your OpenAI API key in the `app.py` file:

   ```python
   openai.api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"
   ```

2. Run the application:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

3. The Gradio interface will launch in your default web browser. You can upload images of the surfboard from different views and get them validated and rated by GPT-4o.

## Project Structure

The project directory is structured as follows:

```
surfboard_validator/
├── requirements.txt
├── app.py
```

- `requirements.txt`: Contains the list of dependencies.
- `app.py`: Contains the Python code for the application.

## Approach

The application uses Gradio for the user interface and OpenAI's GPT-4o for image validation and rating. The images are uploaded through the Gradio interface, encoded to base64, and sent to the GPT-4o model for validation. The model checks if the images match the expected views and provides a rating. If an image does not match the expected view, the model prompts the user to upload a new image with the correct view.

## Code

Here is the complete code for the application:

```python
import gradio as gr
import openai
from PIL import Image
import os
from io import BytesIO
import base64

views = [
    "Top View", "Bottom View", "Left Side View", "Right Side View",
    "Front View", "Back View", "Fin Right Side View", "Fin Left Side View",
    "Fin Front View", "Fin Back View"
]

# Set your OpenAI API key
openai.api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"

def encode_image(image):
    buffered = BytesIO()
    image.save(buffered, format="PNG")
    return base64.b64encode(buffered.getvalue()).decode('utf-8')

def validate_and_rate_images(images, views):
    results = []
    for image, view in zip(images, views):        
        # Prepare the prompt for GPT-4o
        prompt = f"Check if the image is a {view} of a surfboard and rate it from 0 to 10. If it doesn't match, prompt to get a new image with the correct view."
        
        # Call GPT-4o API
        encoded_image = encode_image(image)
        response = openai.Completion.create(
            model="gpt-4o",
            messages=[
                {
                    "role": "user",
                    "content": [
                        {"type": "text", "text": prompt},
                        {
                            "type": "image_url",
                            "image_url":{
                                "url": f"data:image/jpeg;base64,{encoded_image}"
                                },
                        },
                    ],
                }
            ],
            max_tokens=100
        )
        
        # Extract the response
        rating = response.choices.message.content.strip()
        results.append(f"View: {view}, Rating: {rating}")
    
    results_str = "\n".join(results)
    
    return results_str

# Gradio interface
def upload_images(*images):
    return validate_and_rate_images(images, views[:len(images)])

# Create Gradio interface
with gr.Blocks() as demo:
    gr.Markdown("## Surfboard Image Validator")
    image_inputs =  [gr.Image(type="pil", label=f"Image {i+1} - {view}") for i, view in enumerate(views)]

    output = gr.Textbox(label="Results")
    submit_button = gr.Button("Validate and Rate")
    submit_button.click(upload_images, inputs=image_inputs, outputs=output)

# Launch the Gradio app
demo.launch()
```

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the potential of using AI to automate the review process for second-hand surfboards and other water sports equipment. By leveraging GPT-4o and Gradio, we can quickly validate and rate images, helping users sell their products more efficiently. This proof-of-concept was implemented within one hour, showcasing the power of AI and modern development tools.
